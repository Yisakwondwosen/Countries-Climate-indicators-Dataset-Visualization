# Climate Change Data README

## Description
This dataset presents the temperature change with respect to a baseline for various countries and regions around the world, along with related environmental and climate change indicators. The data is collected by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and covers the years 2013 to 2022. Each row represents a different country or region, and each column represents a specific year's temperature change data. For some countries, data may not be available for a specific year, which is indicated as 'NaN' in this dataset.

For those who want a deeper dive or a more refined understanding of this data, it is recommended to utilize available FAO climate change resources, as they provide a more comprehensive perspective on the subject matter.

## Content
The dataset contains the following information:

1. Baseline temperature: The average or standardized temperature for a particular region or country over the years 2013-2022.
2. Temperature change data: Annual temperature change data from the years 2013 to 2022.
3. Environmental and climate change indicators: This data set also includes related environmental and climate change indicators such as greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, ocean acidification, changes in arctic sea ice and polar ice caps, etc.

## Usage
This data can be used to monitor changes over time in temperature, environmental indicators across different regions, and to study the influence of climate change and its resulting historical and current impacts.

## Data Availability
The availability of data for some countries may vary over the years. The corresponding entry will be marked as 'NaN' for those countries.

## Important Note
The data provided is based on the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and may not be exhaustive. Please verify the data and utilise other reliable resources while interpreting the analysis.
